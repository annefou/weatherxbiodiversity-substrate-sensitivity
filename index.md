This repository is a self-contained replication of the headline claim from the reference paper above. It produces:

- A reproducible computational pipeline (Snakefile + notebooks).
- A FORRT-tagged nanopublication chain on the [Science Live platform](https://platform.sciencelive4all.org), documenting the claim, the replication design, and the outcome with full provenance.
- A Zenodo-archived release (source + container image) with a citable DOI.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/annefou/weatherxbiodiversity-substrate-sensitivity.git
cd weatherxbiodiversity-substrate-sensitivity
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate weatherxbiodiversity-substrate-sensitivity
snakemake --cores 1
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/annefou/weatherxbiodiversity-substrate-sensitivity:latest
```

## Structure

- `paper/` — the source paper PDF (drop yours in there).
- `notebooks/` — jupytext `.py` notebooks that drive the pipeline.
- `data/` — downloaded by `notebooks/01_data_download.py`, never committed.
- `nanopubs/` — drafts of the FORRT chain field-by-field, plus the published-URI registry.
- `docs/` — operating manuals (FORRT form fields, chain decision tree, claim-type vocabulary).
- `figures/` — curated figures used in the Jupyter Book.

## Nanopublication chain

The published chain is listed in [`nanopubs/PUBLISHED.md`](nanopubs/PUBLISHED.md). Each step links to its viewer URL on the Science Live platform.
